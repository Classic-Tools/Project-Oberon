Oberon_0 - The Native Oberon Install Tool
-----------------------------------

This install tool should be used with the
instructions contained in the document 
"Installing ETH Native Oberon".

Execute one of the blue commands below 
to configure your disk controller type.  To 
execute a command, point the mouse 
cursor at it and click the middle button.

Config.Disk 0 Standard IDE or ESDI
Config.Disk 1 Adaptec 1520 SCSI

Now execute Install.ShowPartitions to see if
the disk driver can access your hard disk.  If it 
executes correctly, a new viewer displaying 
the current partition tables will open.  If a 
"System.Trap" viewer appears, something 
went wrong.  In that case, see the note in
the appendix of this text. 

1a. Installing to a FAT file system
--------------------------

This section describes how to install Native
Oberon to a file on a FAT file system.  If 
you want to do this, you must first create
a suitable host file in a root directory of your
disk drive (say c:\native.dsk) using the
extend.exe program.  You must then use 
the command "FileSystem=c:\native.dsk"
at the "OBL>" prompt when booting the
install disk.

Execute Config.FAT to confirm that the 
FileSystem setting was made correctly.

Then skip straight to section 3, and then
create a boot diskette in section 4.

If you have not created the host file yet,
execute System.Reboot now and do it.

1b. Creating a new primary partition
-----------------------------

This section describes how to create a new
primary partition for Native Oberon.  Skip
to section 3 if you already have an Oberon
partition.  The number after a command 
specifies the drive (0 is the first drive).

Install.ShowPrimary 0
Install.CreatePrimary 0 <size in Mb>
Install.ShowPartitions

Now go to section 2.

1c. Overwriting a partition of another OS
---------------------------------

This section describes how to overwrite an
existing partition of another operating
system (e.g. DOS) with Native Oberon.  
Using this technique you can install to any 
partition, even a logical drive in an 
extended partition, but then you will have
to boot with a boot diskette or with a boot
manager like Linux's LILO.

Warning: Use the commands in this section
only if you know what you are doing!

Install.ShowPartitions
Install.ChangeType <part> <fromtype> <totype>

The Oberon partition type is 79 in decimal.

2. Initialising the Oberon file system
-----------------------------

Here we initialise the Oberon boot loader
and file system.  You must skip this section if 
you are installing to a FAT file system.

Install.ShowPartitions
Install.InitBootLoader

InitBootLoader should display "done".

The following commands clear the Oberon
partition.  Skip them if you want to retain
the files of an existing Oberon installation.

Install.Unsafe
Install.InitFileSystem

InitFileSystem should display "done".

3. Installing the files
----------------

Here we install the basic Native Oberon 
system on the hard disk.

The Gadgets, Network and other packages
may be installed once the basic system is
running.  Leave the install diskette in the 
boot drive and execute the command:

Install.ReadInstallFloppy SYSTEM

ReadInstallFloppy should display "done".

4. Initialising the boot file
---------------------

Here we initialise the boot file.  Specify your 
display type by executing a command below:

Config.Display 0 Standard VGA 640x480
Config.Display 1 Generic S3-805 1024x768
Config.Display 2 Generic S3-924 1024x768
Config.Display 3 Tseng W32 1024x768
Config.Display 4 Tseng ET4000 1280x1024
Config.Display 5 Tseng ET4000 1024x768
Config.Display 6 Tseng ET4000 800x600
Config.Display 9 Tseng ET4000 640x480
Config.Display 7 Cirrus GD5430 1024x768
Config.Display 8 Video7 Mirage 1024x768

Specify your keyboard type by executing a
command below:

Config.Keyboard 0 US 101-key
Config.Keyboard 1 Swiss
Config.Keyboard 2 German
Config.Keyboard 3 Norwegian

In Native Oberon, F2 is used as neutralise
key, and the Esc key generates the ASCII Esc 
character.  If you want to use the Esc key as 
neutralise, execute: Config.EscNeutralise on

Native Oberon uses the Oberon font.  It 
automatically converts from the Syntax 
font when loading documents.  If you do 
not want this automatic conversion, 
execute: Config.FontConversion off

If you plan to use the SoundBlaster driver,
you have to allocate more space for the
DMA buffer: Config.DMABuffer 14800H

If you are installing to a FAT file system, 
you have to make a boot diskette.  Insert 
a formatted 1.44Mb diskette in the boot 
drive and execute:

Backup.Format\H	(only if unformatted)
Config.BootDiskette

This command should display "done".
Proceed to section 5.

If you are installing to a native partition, 
there are two options:  you can create a 
boot diskette using the command above, or 
you can make your native partition bootable
using the command below.  In the latter
case the PC will always boot into Oberon.
To use another operating system, you 
will have boot it from a diskette.

Config.BootPartition

This command should display "done".

5. Testing the installation
--------------------

Installation of the basic system is now 
completed.  If you created a boot diskette, 
you can now boot from it.  The Native
Oberon core should boot from the diskette,
and then load the rest of the system from
hard disk.

If you made a bootable native partition, 
remove any diskette from the boot drive,
and reboot.  Native Oberon should boot 
from the hard disk.

System.Reboot

If your PC does not boot correctly from the
Native Oberon partition, boot the install 
diskette again and retry the installation 
process carefully.

You can reactive your previous operating 
system using the commands below.  The 
number after the commands specify the 
drive (0 is the first drive).

Install.ShowPrimary 0
Install.SetActivePrimary 0 <id>
Install.ShowPartitions

In the ShowPartitions display a "*" after the
partition number indicates the active 
partition.  This is the partition that will be 
booted when your PC is turned on.

If this does not work, boot your old 
operating system from a diskette, and
use its "fdisk" command (or equivalent)
to reactive its partition.

Appendix: Sending in an error report
------------------------------

If an unexplainable System.Trap occurs, or
if some Install commands give error reports,
you can send the trap text to the author.  
Move the mouse cursor into the System.Trap 
or Install viewer and press F1 to mark it.  
Then execute the command:  ET.StoreAscii *  
to store the text in a file.  Then put a DOS 
diskette in the boot drive and execute the 
command:  Backup.WriteFiles System.Trap ~
Send an explanation of your problem with
the file "SYSTEM.TRA" to muller@inf.ethz.ch.

The following additional commands are available:

Config.Manual on	run in manual mode
Install.ShowParams	show disk parameters
Install.CopyFiles ~	copy files to hard disk
Install.RetrieveFiles ~	copy files from hard disk
Install.Unsafe	put Install in expert mode
Install.DeletePrimary 0 <id>	delete partitions
